# Infrastructure Directory

This directory contains infrastructure configurations and deployment resources for the Quantis platform.

## Contents

- `Dockerfile.api`: Docker configuration for the API service
- `Dockerfile.frontend`: Docker configuration for the frontend application
- `docker-compose.yml`: Compose file for local development and testing
- `ansible/`: Configuration management using Ansible
- `kubernetes/`: Kubernetes manifests for container orchestration
- `terraform/`: Infrastructure as code using Terraform

## Usage

### Local Development

To run the platform locally using Docker Compose:

```bash
cd infrastructure
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start all services including the API, frontend, MLflow, Prometheus, and Grafana.

### Production Deployment

For production deployments:

1. Use Terraform to provision cloud infrastructure
2. Use Kubernetes manifests to deploy containerized applications
3. Use Ansible for configuration management of non-containerized components

## Infrastructure Components

The Quantis platform infrastructure includes:

- **Containerization**: Docker for packaging applications
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for container management
- **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Terraform for cloud resources
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible for system configuration
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for observability
- **Model Tracking**: MLflow for experiment and model tracking

## Environment Configuration

The infrastructure supports multiple environments:
- Development
- Staging
- Production

Each environment has its own configuration in the respective subdirectories.

## Security Considerations

The infrastructure implements several security measures:
- Secret management using Kubernetes secrets
- Network policies for service isolation
- RBAC for access control
- TLS for encrypted communication
