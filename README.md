```bash
git clone https://github.com/abrar2030/Quantis.git
cd Quantis
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Running the Application

#### Backend

```bash
cd api
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

#### Using Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## API Documentation

API documentation is available at `/docs` when the backend is running.

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and accuracy:

### Unit Testing
- Model component tests
- API endpoint tests
- Data processing pipeline tests

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end workflow tests
- Frontend-backend integration tests
- Data pipeline integration tests

### Performance Testing
- Model inference latency tests
- API throughput tests
- Scalability tests

To run tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test modules
pytest tests/test_models.py
pytest tests/test_api.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=quantis tests/
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

Quantis uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

### Continuous Integration
