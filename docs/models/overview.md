# Models Documentation

This document provides comprehensive information about the machine learning models used in the Quantis time series forecasting platform, including their architecture, training process, and deployment.

## Overview

Quantis uses state-of-the-art machine learning models for time series forecasting. The primary model is the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), which is specifically designed for multi-horizon time series forecasting with mixed covariates. The platform also supports other models and allows for custom model implementation.

## Model Architecture

### Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)

The Temporal Fusion Transformer is the primary forecasting model in Quantis. It combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal relationships.

#### Architecture Components

The TFT architecture consists of several key components:

1. **Variable Selection Networks**: Identify relevant input features at each time step
2. **Gated Residual Networks (GRNs)**: Enable efficient information flow with skip connections
3. **Temporal Processing Layers**: 
   - LSTM layers for local processing
   - Self-attention layers for long-range dependencies
4. **Multi-head Attention Mechanism**: Captures different temporal patterns simultaneously
5. **Quantile Outputs**: Provides prediction intervals rather than just point forecasts

#### Input Types

TFT handles three types of variables:
- **Static Covariates**: Features that remain constant for a time series (e.g., location, product category)
- **Known Future Inputs**: Variables known in advance for the forecast horizon (e.g., holidays, planned events)
- **Observed Inputs**: Historical values only available up to the forecast point (e.g., past values, weather)

#### Interpretability Features

TFT provides several interpretability mechanisms:
- **Variable Importance**: Identifies which features are most influential
- **Temporal Attention**: Shows which historical time points influence each forecast point
- **Persistent vs. Temporal Effects**: Distinguishes between long-term and short-term influences

### Other Supported Models

In addition to TFT, Quantis supports:

1. **Prophet**: Facebook's decomposable time series model that handles:
   - Multiple seasonality patterns
   - Holiday effects
   - Trend changepoints

2. **ARIMA/SARIMA**: Traditional statistical models for time series that capture:
   - Autoregressive components
   - Moving average components
   - Seasonal patterns

3. **XGBoost/LightGBM**: Gradient boosting models with engineered time features:
   - High performance on tabular data
   - Ability to capture non-linear relationships
   - Feature importance metrics

4. **DeepAR**: Recurrent neural network-based model:
   - Probabilistic forecasting
   - Handles multiple related time series
   - Captures complex patterns

## Model Training

### Training Process

The model training process in Quantis follows these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Time series alignment
   - Feature engineering
   - Train/validation/test splitting
   - Normalization/scaling

2. **Hyperparameter Optimization**:
   - Automated hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization
   - Cross-validation for robust evaluation
   - Early stopping to prevent overfitting

3. **Model Training**:
   - Distributed training for large datasets
   - Checkpointing for training resumption
   - Progress monitoring and logging

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Performance metrics calculation (MAPE, MAE, RMSE, etc.)
   - Comparison against baseline models
   - Backtesting on historical data

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Quantis uses a systematic approach to hyperparameter tuning:

1. **Optimization Strategy**: Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes
2. **Search Space**: Model-specific parameter ranges defined by experts
3. **Objective Function**: Minimizing validation loss (typically quantile loss)
4. **Cross-Validation**: Time series cross-validation with expanding windows

Key hyperparameters for TFT include:
- Hidden layer sizes
- Number of attention heads
- Dropout rates
- Learning rate
- Batch size

### Training Configuration

Training can be configured through the UI or API with the following options:

```python
training_config = {
    "model_type": "tft",
    "hidden_size": 64,
    "attention_heads": 4,
    "dropout_rate": 0.1,
    "learning_rate": 0.001,
    "batch_size": 256,
    "max_epochs": 100,
    "early_stopping_patience": 10,
    "loss_function": "quantile",
    "quantiles": [0.1, 0.5, 0.9],
    "context_length": 30,  # Days of history to use
    "prediction_length": 14  # Days to forecast
}
```

## Model Serving

### Deployment Options

Quantis supports multiple deployment options for trained models:

1. **REST API**: Models are served via FastAPI endpoints for real-time predictions
2. **Batch Inference**: Scheduled batch processing for large-scale forecasting
3. **Edge Deployment**: Optimized models for edge devices (limited functionality)
4. **Embedded Python**: Models can be exported for use in external Python environments

### Serving Architecture

The model serving architecture consists of:

1. **Model Registry**: Central repository for trained models
2. **Serving Layer**: Scalable infrastructure for model inference
3. **Caching Layer**: Redis-based caching for frequent predictions
4. **Load Balancer**: Distributes requests across multiple model instances

### Scaling and Performance

To ensure high performance and scalability:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple model instances behind a load balancer
2. **Model Optimization**: ONNX conversion for faster inference
3. **Batching**: Efficient processing of multiple prediction requests
4. **Resource Allocation**: Automatic scaling based on request volume
