4. Contact your administrator if the issue persists

#### Poor Forecast Accuracy

If forecast accuracy is lower than expected:

1. Check data quality (missing values, outliers)
2. Ensure sufficient historical data is available
3. Try different models or feature combinations
4. Consider adding external variables that might influence the target

#### Data Import Failures

If data import is failing:

1. Verify the data format matches the expected format
2. Check for special characters or encoding issues
3. Ensure date/time formats are consistent
4. Try importing a smaller sample first

### Error Messages

Common error messages and their solutions:

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: How much historical data is needed for accurate forecasts?**

A: As a general rule, you should have at least 3 times as much historical data as the forecast horizon. For example, if you want to forecast 30 days ahead, aim for at least 90 days of history. More complex patterns may require more data.

**Q: Can Quantis handle multiple seasonality patterns?**

A: Yes, models like Temporal Fusion Transformer and Prophet can automatically detect and account for multiple seasonal patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).

**Q: How often should I retrain my models?**

A: It depends on how quickly your data patterns change. As a best practice, consider retraining:
- When new significant data becomes available
- When forecast accuracy starts to decline
- On a regular schedule (monthly or quarterly)
- After major events that might change the underlying patterns

**Q: Can I export forecasts to other systems?**

A: Yes, forecasts can be exported in several formats:
- CSV or Excel for spreadsheet applications
- JSON for programmatic use
- Direct API integration with other systems
- Scheduled reports via email

**Q: How does Quantis handle confidential data?**

A: Quantis implements several security measures:
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging of all actions
- Option for on-premises deployment for sensitive data
