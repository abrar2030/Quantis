- Webhook configuration and usage

Example API authentication flow:
```
POST /users/token
```

Request body:
```json
{
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

### Architecture Documentation

The `architecture/overview.md` file details the system architecture, including:

- API integration to understand available endpoints and authentication

### For End Users

End users should refer to the user guides for:
- Getting started with the platform
- Understanding available features and capabilities
- Learning best practices for time series forecasting
- Interpreting prediction results and confidence intervals
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Documentation Standards

All documentation in this directory follows these standards:

1. **Markdown Format**: Documentation is written in Markdown for readability both in the repository and when rendered as HTML
2. **Comprehensive Examples**: Code examples and configuration snippets are included where applicable
3. **Visual Aids**: Diagrams and screenshots are used to illustrate complex concepts
4. **Version Consistency**: Documentation is kept in sync with the current software version
5. **Cross-References**: Related documentation is linked for easy navigation

## Contributing to Documentation

When contributing to the documentation:

1. **Follow Existing Structure**: Maintain the established directory structure
2. **Use Markdown**: Write all documentation in Markdown format
3. **Include Examples**: Provide code examples for technical concepts
4. **Add Diagrams**: Use diagrams to illustrate complex interactions (store in the `images/` directory)
5. **Update Related Docs**: When changing one document, update related documents for consistency
6. **Review Links**: Ensure all internal and external links are valid
7. **Test Code Samples**: Verify that all included code examples work as described

### Documentation Review Process

All documentation changes undergo the following review process:
1. Technical accuracy review by subject matter experts
2. Readability review for clarity and comprehension
3. Structural review for consistency with existing documentation
4. Final approval by documentation maintainers

## Documentation Roadmap

The documentation is continuously evolving with the following enhancements planned:

1. **Interactive API Documentation**: Enhanced Swagger UI integration
2. **Video Tutorials**: Adding video content for complex workflows
3. **Internationalization**: Translations for key user guides
4. **Searchable Documentation**: Improved search functionality
5. **Feedback System**: User feedback collection on documentation quality

## Troubleshooting Documentation Issues

If you encounter issues with the documentation:

1. **Missing Information**: File an issue with the specific topic that needs coverage
2. **Outdated Content**: Submit a pull request with updated information
3. **Unclear Explanations**: Suggest improvements through the feedback system
4. **Broken Links**: Report broken links through the issue tracker

## Integration with Other Systems

The documentation integrates with:

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Documentation is automatically built and deployed
2. **API Gateway**: OpenAPI specifications are synchronized with the API gateway
3. **Knowledge Base**: User guides are integrated with the support knowledge base
4. **Training Materials**: Documentation serves as the foundation for training

## Technical Specifications

The documentation system supports:

1. **Markdown Rendering**: Converting Markdown to HTML for web display
2. **Code Syntax Highlighting**: For multiple programming languages
3. **Diagram Generation**: Using Mermaid or PlantUML syntax
4. **Version Control**: Documentation versioning aligned with software releases
5. **PDF Generation**: Exporting documentation to PDF format

## Security Considerations

Documentation security practices include:

1. **Credential Scrubbing**: Ensuring no real credentials appear in examples
2. **Access Control**: Restricting access to internal-only documentation
3. **Sensitive Information**: Guidelines for documenting security-related features

## Performance Optimization

Documentation performance is optimized through:

1. **Image Compression**: Optimizing images for web delivery
2. **Lazy Loading**: Implementing lazy loading for heavy content
3. **Caching**: Caching documentation pages for faster access
4. **Minification**: Minifying HTML/CSS for production deployment

This comprehensive documentation serves as the single source of truth for all aspects of the Quantis platform, ensuring that developers, users, and stakeholders have access to accurate, up-to-date information about the system's capabilities, architecture, and usage.
