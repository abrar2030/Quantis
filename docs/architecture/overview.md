# Quantis Architecture Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Quantis time series forecasting platform architecture, explaining how different components interact to deliver advanced forecasting capabilities.

## System Architecture

Quantis follows a modern microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns between different components. The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and deployable in various environments from development to production.

### High-Level Architecture

The Quantis platform consists of the following major components:

1. **Frontend Application**: A React-based web application that provides the user interface for interacting with the platform
2. **Backend API**: A FastAPI-based REST API that handles requests from the frontend and communicates with the models
3. **ML Models**: Time series forecasting models that process data and generate predictions
4. **Data Processing Pipeline**: Components for data ingestion, processing, and feature engineering
5. **Monitoring System**: Tools for monitoring model performance, system health, and user activity
6. **Infrastructure**: Deployment configurations for various environments using Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform

### Component Interactions

The components interact in the following manner:

1. Users interact with the **Frontend Application** through their web browsers
2. The frontend makes API calls to the **Backend API** to request data, submit configurations, or trigger predictions
3. The **Backend API** processes these requests, performs authentication/authorization, and communicates with the appropriate services
4. For prediction requests, the API communicates with the **ML Models** component
5. The **Data Processing Pipeline** prepares data for model training and inference
6. The **Monitoring System** collects metrics from all components to provide observability
7. The entire system is deployed and managed using the **Infrastructure** configurations

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Raw time series data enters the system through the API or batch processes
2. **Data Processing**: The data processing pipeline cleans, transforms, and prepares the data
3. **Feature Engineering**: Features are extracted and transformed for model consumption
4. **Model Training**: Models are trained on historical data with features
5. **Model Serving**: Trained models are deployed for inference
6. **Prediction Generation**: Models generate predictions based on input data
7. **Visualization**: Predictions and insights are visualized in the frontend dashboard

## Technology Stack

Quantis leverages a modern technology stack:

### Frontend
- React.js for UI components and state management
- Context API for state management
- Modern CSS for styling
- Chart.js for data visualization

### Backend
- FastAPI for high-performance API development
- Pydantic for data validation
- JWT for authentication

### Machine Learning
- PyTorch and TensorFlow for model development
- MLflow for experiment tracking
- Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) for time series forecasting

### Data Processing
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Feature store for feature management

### Infrastructure
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Terraform for infrastructure as code
- Ansible for configuration management

### Monitoring
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Custom model monitoring for ML-specific metrics

## Security Architecture

Quantis implements several security measures:

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for API access
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different user types
3. **Encryption**: Data encryption in transit and at rest
4. **Secure Configuration**: Secrets management using Kubernetes secrets
5. **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all inputs using Pydantic schemas

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed to scale in the following ways:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Components can be scaled independently based on load
2. **Database Scaling**: Database services can be scaled or sharded as needed
3. **Model Serving**: Model inference can be distributed across multiple instances
4. **Stateless Design**: API services are designed to be stateless for easy scaling

## Future Architecture Enhancements

Planned architectural improvements include:

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Implementing message queues for asynchronous processing
2. **Feature Store**: Dedicated feature store for improved feature management
3. **Model Registry**: Enhanced model versioning and deployment
4. **A/B Testing Framework**: Infrastructure for testing different model versions
5. **Real-Time Streaming**: Support for real-time data ingestion and processing

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the Quantis platform while allowing for future growth and enhancement as requirements evolve.
