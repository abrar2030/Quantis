# Monitoring Directory

## Overview

The `monitoring` directory contains a comprehensive suite of tools, configurations, and scripts for monitoring the Quantis platform's performance, health, and operational metrics. This monitoring infrastructure is critical for ensuring system reliability, detecting anomalies, predicting potential issues before they impact users, and providing deep insights into system behavior across all components of the platform.

## Directory Structure

The monitoring system is organized into the following components:

- **grafana_dashboards/**: Pre-configured Grafana dashboard templates for visualizing metrics and creating operational dashboards
- **model_monitor.py**: Python script implementing sophisticated monitoring for machine learning model performance and drift detection
- **prometheus.yml**: Configuration file for the Prometheus monitoring system that defines scraping intervals, targets, and alerting rules

## Key Components

### Grafana Dashboards

The `grafana_dashboards` directory contains JSON templates for Grafana dashboards that visualize key metrics from the Quantis platform. These dashboards provide real-time and historical views of system performance, enabling operators to:

- Monitor system health at a glance
- Track key performance indicators over time
- Identify trends and anomalies
- Correlate events across different system components
- Create custom visualizations for specific monitoring needs

Each dashboard is designed with specific use cases in mind:

1. **System Overview Dashboard**: High-level view of all system components
2. **Model Performance Dashboard**: Detailed metrics on model accuracy and performance
3. **API Performance Dashboard**: Response times, error rates, and throughput
4. **Resource Utilization Dashboard**: CPU, memory, and disk usage across services
5. **User Activity Dashboard**: User engagement and feature usage patterns

### Model Monitoring

The `model_monitor.py` script implements sophisticated monitoring for machine learning models, tracking:

- **Prediction Accuracy**: Comparing predictions against actual outcomes
- **Data Drift**: Detecting changes in input data distributions using KL divergence
- **Concept Drift**: Identifying when model performance degrades over time
- **Feature Importance**: Tracking how feature importance changes over time using SHAP values
- **Model Performance Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, and other relevant metrics

The script integrates with Prometheus for metrics collection and alerting, enabling automated detection of model degradation. The implementation uses the following approach:

```python
def calculate_drift(self, reference, production):
    kl_div = self._kl_divergence(reference, production)
    self.data_drift.set(kl_div)

def _kl_divergence(self, p, q):
    return np.sum(p * np.log(p / q))

def track_feature_importance(self, shap_values):
    for idx, value in enumerate(shap_values):
        self.feature_importance[f"feature_{idx}"] = value
```

This monitoring system allows for:

- Early detection of model degradation
- Automated retraining triggers based on performance thresholds
- Comprehensive model performance tracking
- A/B testing of different model versions
- Detailed reporting on model behavior in production

### Prometheus Configuration

The `prometheus.yml` file configures the Prometheus monitoring system, defining:

- **Scrape Intervals**: How frequently metrics are collected (default: 15s)
- **Evaluation Intervals**: How frequently alerting rules are evaluated
- **Target Endpoints**: Which services to collect metrics from
- **Alerting Rules**: Conditions that trigger alerts
- **Alertmanager Integration**: How alerts are routed and managed

The configuration includes the following scrape targets:

1. **Prometheus itself**: For self-monitoring
2. **Model Metrics**: Collecting metrics from the model serving endpoints
3. **Node Exporter**: For system-level metrics from all hosts

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']

  - job_name: 'model_metrics'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8000']
    metrics_path: '/metrics'

  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets: ['localhost:9093']

rule_files:
  - "alert_rules.yml"
```

## Monitoring Architecture

The monitoring system follows a multi-layered approach:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: Collects metrics from various sources
   - Prometheus exporters for system metrics
   - Custom instrumentation for application metrics
   - Model-specific metrics from the ML pipeline

2. **Storage Layer**: Stores time-series data
   - Prometheus for short-term storage
   - Long-term storage solutions for historical data

3. **Processing Layer**: Analyzes and processes metrics
   - Alerting rules for anomaly detection
   - Aggregation for dashboard visualization

4. **Visualization Layer**: Presents metrics in an actionable format
   - Grafana dashboards for interactive exploration
   - Automated reports for stakeholders

5. **Alerting Layer**: Notifies operators of issues
   - Email notifications for critical alerts
   - Integration with incident management systems
   - Escalation policies for unresolved issues

## Metrics Collected

## Performance Considerations

The monitoring system is designed for minimal performance impact:

1. **Resource Usage**:
   - Prometheus: 1-2 CPU cores, 2-4GB RAM for most deployments
   - Grafana: 1 CPU core, 1GB RAM
   - Consider dedicated monitoring infrastructure for large deployments

2. **Storage Requirements**:
   - Calculate based on: metrics × cardinality × scrape_interval × retention_period
   - Implement downsampling for long-term storage
   - Use appropriate storage backends for different retention needs

3. **Network Impact**:
   - Pull-based model reduces impact on monitored services
   - Configure appropriate scrape intervals (15s default)
   - Use filtering to reduce unnecessary metric collection

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Enable authentication for Prometheus and Grafana
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Use TLS for all connections
   - Rotate credentials regularly

2. **Network Security**:
   - Place monitoring infrastructure in a separate security zone
   - Use firewalls to restrict access to monitoring endpoints
   - Implement network segmentation

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Ensure sensitive metrics are properly secured
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Consider data anonymization where appropriate

## Extending the Monitoring System

### Adding New Metrics

1. **Instrument Application Code**:
   ```python
   from prometheus_client import Counter, Gauge, Histogram
   
   # Define metrics
   request_counter = Counter('http_requests_total', 'Total HTTP Requests', ['method', 'endpoint'])
   request_latency = Histogram('http_request_duration_seconds', 'HTTP request latency', ['method', 'endpoint'])
   
   # Use metrics
   @app.route('/api/data')
   def get_data():
       request_counter.labels(method='GET', endpoint='/api/data').inc()
